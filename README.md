This application is designed as a spider combined with an injector, written in Python. The injections.list file is supplied with common XSS and SQLi attack vectors. Multiple encodings as well as path modifactions will be included in the final product. I decided to create this as an attempt to assist myself in bug bounties.

Project status: "work-in-progress"
